## 🪐🔭 *Upcoming*

## 🧪 0.5.0

- fix: catch error when Package has no `composer.json`

## 🧪 0.4.5

- feature: new Neos Tab in Sidebar

### ✨ Merged Array Tree

Starting with this release the `ts-fusion-runtime` package is implemented, which provides the (hopefully) same MergedArrayTree as its PHP-Counterpart does.
The MergedArrayTree has already been put to use in the Diagnostic and Completion capabilities which greatly increases their usefulness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Properties inside of `@propTypes` do currently not count into the properties of the prototype.

### 🧪 Configuration and `FLOW_CONTEXT`

Another big feature is everything connected to the Configuration. It is now possible to not only change the used `FLOW_CONTEXT` but to also view the Configuration in the new Neos-ViewContainer.

> [!WARNING]
> This is still experimental.

## 🚀 0.3.14

- feature: Additional `$` before an EEL-Expression inside AFX will now be diagnosed
- feature: duplicated statements get diagnosed
- feature: Diagnostics can now be separately enabled/disabled
- feature: WIP Signature Help
- feature: Definitions of Controller and Actions in `Routing.fusion`. Actions are suggested. Works only if they are in the following format:

    ```neosfusion
    Neos.Neos.LoginController {
      index = Neos.Neos:View.Login {
          site = ${site}
          styles = ${styles}
          username = ${username}
          flashMessages = ${flashMessages}
      }
    }
    ```

- feature: When NodeTypes get created by the QuickAction. The new file will be put into a folder structure following the prototype name. Works only when `NodeTypes` folder is present.
- perf: getting Workspace Symbols (CMD⌘ + T) is now faster
