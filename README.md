## Functionality

Most of the common Language Server Features are supported.

### [Goto Definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition) (*CMD + Click*)

Currently works on **Prototypes** and fusion **Properties** (detected by `this` or `props`).

Support for EEL-Helper is present, but currently not for functions (`q(node)`) only for classes (`String.empty()`).

ðŸš§ It also works on `controller` and `action` properties in `Neos.Fusion:ActionUri` and  `Neos.Fusion:UriBuilder` as long as the Action can be found.

### Find References (*Shift + CMD + Click*)

Currently works on **Prototypes** only.

### Hover

Works on properties and prototypes in Fusion and AFX.

Support for EEL-Helper ist present but the description parsing is not working a 100% correct.

### Document Symbols (*Shift + CMD + O*)

Every Symbol in the document can be easily accessed.

### Workspace Symbols (*CMD + T*)

Every Prototype can be easily listed via the WorkspaceSymbols. Overwritten Prototypes are also shown.

### Resource Goto Definition, Completion and Hover

It currently only works when it is a fusion string. When the file is an image it gets preview on hover.

## Diagnostics

### Fusion Properties

It is based on the definition capability. Because the definition capability does not work perfectly in complex fusion the feature is marked as `experimental`. If it bothers you too much it can be disabled in the extension configuration.  

![goto image](https://github.com/sjsone/vscode-neos-fusion-lsp/blob/main/images/diagnostics_example.gif?raw=true)



If you want to ignore an Error or Warning you can use a `@fusion-ignore`  -comment in the line before:

 ![goto image](https://github.com/sjsone/vscode-neos-fusion-lsp/blob/main/images/fusion_ignore_property.png?raw=true)

### Resource

Described [here](#Resource Goto Definition, Completion and Hover) resource strings are diagnosed when the file cannot be found.

### AFX Tag Names

In AFX a tag has to be closed either by a corresponding closing tag or via self-closing. It will be marked as an Diagnostic-Error if it is not closed.

### EEL-Helper-Arguments

As EEL-Helper are parsed so are the arguments. If an arguments is missing it is marked as an Error. If it has too many it is a warning.

### Prototypes

Prototypes can be marked as deprecated via the Extension Configuration. The deprecation can be fixed via a Quick-Action in the context menu.

### Empty EEL-Expression

If an empty EEL-Expression `obj = ${}` is used instead of an literal null `obj = null`  it will be marked as deprecated with an Quick-Action-Fix.

## Semantic Comments

Every semantic comments starts with `@fusion-` followed by the name. Every comment works in Fusion (no hash comment) and AFX.

Some comments have optional parameters which is a simple comma separated list:

```javascript
// @fusion-typeOfComment[argument1, argument2]
```

### `@fusion-ignore`

With this comment the next line will be ignored from fusion property diagnostics, so no error, warning or info reporting. 

If placed above a Tag in AFX the attributes will be affected as well. Even if they are in the lines below. 

#### Parameters

If no arguments are provided every property-warning will be ignored. 

Every argument is treated as an property path. 

In this example everything in `props.user` will be ignored but `props.noProperty` not.

```javascript
// @fusion-ignore[props.user]
test = ${props.user.notExisitingProperty && props.noProperty}
```

### `@fusion-ignore-block`

With this comment every fusion property diagnostic in the block and below will be ignored. 

#### Parameters

If no arguments are provided every property-warning will be ignored. 

Every argument is treated as an property path. 

Works the same as `@fusion-ignore`.

## Outline

In the Explorer-View the outline is filled with symbols found in the current document.

## ðŸš§ Semantic Token Highlighting 

The language server currently highlights  `controller` and `action` properties in `Neos.Fusion:ActionUri` and  `Neos.Fusion:UriBuilder` . Even if the action cannot be found.  

This feature will be extended in the future.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

The language-server relies heavily on the [ts-fusion-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-fusion-parser) which is a typescript  port of the "official" [Fusion Parser](https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/tree/8.2/Neos.Fusion/Classes/Core).

Essentially it reads all AST-Nodes from the fusion parser and checks if the curser is on one of these AST-Nodes. If it is, the relevant actions are carried out.

The AFX and EEL parser is part of the [ts-fusion-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-fusion-parser).

### Is there a road map?

Currently there is no road map.  

### What about EEL-Helper and NodeType-Configuration

There is rudimentary support for EEL-Helper. Hover and Goto-Definition is currently (somewhat) supported.

## Known Bugs

- EEL-Helper hover description will parse the first description it can find which may not be the correct one
- EEL-Helper with the same name may be handled incorrectly
